| Action                           | Key                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Play Notes**                   | `W, E, R, T, Y...` etc. |
| **Start / Stop Recording**       | `Left Ctrl`             |
| **Toggle Sustain (Hold Notes)**  | `Space`                 |
| **Shift Octave Up**              | `→`                     |

## **Recording and Shortcuts**

1. Press **Left Ctrl** to start recording.
   → Notes you play are captured with timing and duration.
2. Press **Left Ctrl** again to stop.
3. Enter a **filename** for the recording.
4. Choose whether to **assign a shortcut key** (`Y/N`).

   * If yes, press any key to bind it.
5. Your recording appears in the dropdown and inside the `recordings/` folder.

Instantly replay any saved recording using its assigned shortcut key.

---

## **How It Works**

* **Pygame mixer channels** handle up to 52 notes simultaneously.
* Each key triggers a corresponding sound from the `assets/` folder based on the active octave.
* Recordings store key events (timing, duration, and sound paths) as structured dictionaries.
* **Pydub** layers these sounds to generate `.wav` files asynchronously via threads.
